# DevDAO(CodeJudge)

AI is rewriting how companies hire. The old grind of pure DSA is dying out, replaced by rounds that demand real engineering instincts — building live features, fixing production-style bugs, crafting clean schemas, writing SQL that mirrors real data problems, designing scalable systems, and proving you can ship under pressure.

Teams want builders, not puzzle solvers.

Developers need a battleground that reflects this new reality — a place to practice practical engineering skills with instant feedback, real constraints, and the adrenaline of a live match.

This is that battleground.

DevDAO (CodeJudge) is a next-gen arena for head-to-head coding battles across Solidity, SQL, schema design, and frontend machine-coding. Fast, interactive, and brutally realistic — built to push you to think, code, debug, and deliver exactly like you would inside an engineering team.

## ⚙️ Core Features (Deep Implementation Details)

### **1. Real-Time Competitive 1v1 Matchmaking 🎮**
Experience the thrill of live coding battles:
- **Instant Matching**: Convex-powered matchmaking finds opponents in <1 second
- **Live Progress Tracking**: Watch your opponent's test cases pass in real-time
- **Session Management**: Automatic room creation, readiness checks, and result synchronization
- **Reactive UI**: Zero manual refreshes - everything updates automatically via Convex subscriptions


### ⚡ 2. **Frontend Machine Coding (CodeSandbox + Monaco + Jest)**

* Editor powered by **Monaco** with language services, autocomplete, and error markers.
* CodeSandbox runtime runs React code in an isolated iframe.
* On every save:

  * The component is bundled in a virtual FS.
  * Jest test suite runs inside the sandbox.
  * Results stream back with pass/fail, diff, and console logs.
* No page reloads — evaluation happens in a worker-like sandbox.

### 🛠 3. **Smart Contract Challenge Engine (solc + Ganache)**

* User submits Solidity code.
* `solc` compiles inside a Cloudflare Worker-compatible environment.
* Compilation artifacts stored temporarily in memory.
* Ganache spawns an **ephemeral chain per submission**.
* Contract deployment:

  * Deploy using the compiled ABI + bytecode.
  * Seed accounts with deterministic balances.
* Tests run using ethers.js against the deployed contract.
* Full logs (events, reverts, gas) returned to UI.

### 4. **SQL & Schema Design** 🗄️
- **Dynamic Schema Validation**: Parse user DDL → Generate tables → Seed data → Execute queries
- **In-Memory Database**: Fresh SQL instance per attempt for isolated testing
- **Visual ERD Builder**: Design database schemas with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Result Diff Engine**: Precise comparison of expected vs actual query outputs
  
### **3. Intelligent Documentation via Firecrawl 📚**
Never leave the coding environment:
- **Auto-Scraped Docs**: Official documentation automatically fetched for each challenge
- **Contextual Help**: Relevant API references, syntax guides, and best practices
- **Smart Caching**: Docs are pre-loaded and instantly accessible
- **Zero Distractions**: No tab-switching, no context loss

### 🔍 6. **Observability (Sentry)**

* Every code execution path wrapped in instrumentation.
* Traces include: compile time, execution time, deploy time, test duration.
* Frontend captures editor crashes, sandbox errors, and network issues.
* Useful for debugging user-step failures in real-time.
