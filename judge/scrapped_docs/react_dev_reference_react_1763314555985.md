# React Reference Overview [Link for this heading](https://react.dev/reference/react\#undefined "Link for this heading")

This section provides detailed reference documentation for working with React. For an introduction to React, please visit the [Learn](https://react.dev/learn) section.

The React reference documentation is broken down into functional subsections:

## React [Link for React ](https://react.dev/reference/react\#react "Link for React ")

Programmatic React features:

- [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) \- Use different React features from your components.
- [Components](https://react.dev/reference/react/components) \- Built-in components that you can use in your JSX.
- [APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react/apis) \- APIs that are useful for defining components.
- [Directives](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/directives) \- Provide instructions to bundlers compatible with React Server Components.

## React DOM [Link for React DOM ](https://react.dev/reference/react\#react-dom "Link for React DOM ")

React DOM contains features that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). This section is broken into the following:

- [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks) \- Hooks for web applications which run in the browser DOM environment.
- [Components](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components) \- React supports all of the browser built-in HTML and SVG components.
- [APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom) \- The `react-dom` package contains methods supported only in web applications.
- [Client APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client) \- The `react-dom/client` APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser).
- [Server APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) \- The `react-dom/server` APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server.
- [Static APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static) \- The `react-dom/static` APIs let you generate static HTML for React components.

## React Compiler [Link for React Compiler ](https://react.dev/reference/react\#react-compiler "Link for React Compiler ")

The React Compiler is a build-time optimization tool that automatically memoizes your React components and values:

- [Configuration](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/configuration) \- Configuration options for React Compiler.
- [Directives](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/directives) \- Function-level directives to control compilation.
- [Compiling Libraries](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/compiling-libraries) \- Guide for shipping pre-compiled library code.

## ESLint Plugin React Hooks [Link for ESLint Plugin React Hooks ](https://react.dev/reference/react\#eslint-plugin-react-hooks "Link for ESLint Plugin React Hooks ")

The [ESLint plugin for React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) helps enforce the Rules of React:

- [Lints](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) \- Detailed documentation for each lint with examples.

## Rules of React [Link for Rules of React ](https://react.dev/reference/react\#rules-of-react "Link for Rules of React ")

React has idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications:

- [Components and Hooks must be pure](https://react.dev/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure) – Purity makes your code easier to understand, debug, and allows React to automatically optimize your components and hooks correctly.
- [React calls Components and Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks) – React is responsible for rendering components and hooks when necessary to optimize the user experience.
- [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) – Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.

## Legacy APIs [Link for Legacy APIs ](https://react.dev/reference/react\#legacy-apis "Link for Legacy APIs ")

- [Legacy APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react/legacy) \- Exported from the `react` package, but not recommended for use in newly written code.
